## What Is Data Visualization

At the simplest level, data visualization is the act of using pictures to represent data.  We are using some kind of chart, diagram, plot, etc to convey some information in the data in a more human digestible format.

The biggest challenge in data visualization is projection.  trying to project multi dimensional data sets into a 2D World

## Data Visualization and Data Science?

Data Visualization is a field that has overlap with data science.  In many data science problems, you are trying to answer a question by looking at the data, and it usually helps to visualize the data to better answer the question.

For example, a large company might wonder why are sales low in the northwest?  You could look at all of the internal company data as well as potentially external data to help find a trend, pattern, correlation, etc between some feature of your data set and the outcome.  Then to emphasize the correlation you may visualize the features that you have found to be interesting in different regions to help demonstrate your point.


## What is D3?

D3 is a data visualization library made by [Mike Bostock](https://twitter.com/mbostock)

It stands for _ddd_, which is short for for data driven document.

Mike was a engineer and graphics editor for the NY Times.  The NY times has done some great visualizations:

* [Global Water Change](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/09/science/mapping-three-decades-of-global-water-change.html)
* [Family Income And How It Affects 	College Chances](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/28/upshot/you-draw-it-how-family-income-affects-childrens-college-chances.html)

You can also find many examples of D3 in action (along with the code) at [https://bl.ocks.org/](https://bl.ocks.org/).  Blocks was written by Mike Bostock as a way to show off D3 projects more easily.

__D3 v4__

The latest version of D3 is version 4.  Many of the tutorials you'll see online and examples in blocks are all written in v3.  Make sure you're aware of the version number when you're looking for examples.

## Why D3?

D3 has become a very popular tool for web visualization.  It is very popular and very powerful, but it may not be the right tool for the job in certain circumstances.

__May not be right if ...__

If you want a simple chart and don't need a ton of customization, [chartjs](http://www.chartjs.org/) may be an easier option.

If you are mostly interested in exploring the data and doing rapid feature selection. A tool like [tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) may be better.  Tableau makes selecting different data sources as the X and Y axis very quick and easy.  It is mainly a gui tool for data exploration.  You can also export a png of your visualization when you're done.

__Great choice for ...__

Custom visualizations that aren't supported by simple libraries

Dynamic visualizations that need to change on the fly and potentially animate

## D3 And The DOM

D3 can be used to select elements in the DOM, and in that way, is not graphing specific.  Some people choose to use D3 for all DOM selection instead of a tool like jQuery.

Let's work with this document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>D3 DOM DEMO</title>
  <style>
  	 .intro {
  	   font-size: 6em;
  	 }
  	 .items {
  	   color: green;
  	   font-size: 1.4em;
  	 }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 id="page-title">This is my first D3 example!</h1>
  <p class="first-paragraph">Here's my first paragraph.</p>
  <p>Here are some reasons why d3 is dope:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Makes data more engaging.</li>
    <li>Has built-in math helpers.</li>
    <li>Includes several additional data types.</li>
    <li>Supports graph animations.</li>
    <li>Makes drawing graph axes a breeze!</li>
  </ol>
  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Open this page up in Chrome, hop into the console, and type `d3`. If you get an object back, you can be confident that you've set things up correctly!

Note: The source in the script tag refers to version 4 of d3 (hence the `d3.v4.js`). This version of d3 was released in June of 2016. If you're reading d3 tutorials from before then, you should be aware that version 4 introduced a number of changes that aren't compatible with earlier versions of d3. We'll focus on version 4 here, but just be careful if you're reading older tutorials!

### Selecting DOM elements with d3

d3 can do a lot of data manipulation, but even if you're not working with any data, it can also be used to manipulate the DOM. While its functionality doesn't intersect entirely with jQuery (you can't easily do event delegation with d3, for instance), when it comes to traversing the DOM and appending things to it, d3 and jQuery can, in many cases, be used interchangeably. 

Using the same HTML as in the above, hop into the console and let's make our first selection:

```javascript
var firstSelection = d3.select("#page-title");
```

The `d3.select` method is sort of analogous to the vanilla JavaScript `document.querySelector` method, in that both accept a string corresponding to a CSS selector, and both just search until they find a single element matching the selector. If you'd like to find all elements matching the selector, you should use `d3.selectAll` (analogous to `document.querySelectorAll`).

If you look at `firstSelection` in the console, you'll see that it's got a structure we haven't seen before: it's an object constructed from the native d3 `Selection` function, and it has two properties: `_groups` and `_parents`. The underscore in front of these names indicates that they are intended to be *private*; if you find yourself accessing these properties directly, you're probably using d3 incorrectly. For example, if you want to pass from the d3 selection object to the HTML element, you can call the `.nodes` method, which will return to you an array of the HTML elements:

```javascript
firstSelection.nodes()[0]; // this should return the h1 element on the page.
```

Method chaining is a major part of d3. Working with d3 selections exclusively, rather than mixing d3 selections with plain old HTML elements, allows us to use method chaining with ease. For instance, you can chain together multiple selections:

```javascript
var firstLi = d3.select("ol").select("li");
```

### Modifying DOM Elements With D3

Just like in jQuery, we can modify the attributes and style of our selections using d3. Try writing the following examples in the Chrome console:

```javascript
// more method chaining here!
d3.select("#page-title")
	.style("color", "blue")
	.attr("class", "intro");
```

The above code will select the `h1` with an id of "page-title," set the font color to blue, and add a class of "intro".

When adding or removing classes, it's also common to use the `classed` method, which takes a string and a boolean. The string should be a space-separated list of class names, and the boolean determines whether those classes should be added to or removed from the selection:

```javascript
// adds "items" class to all li's:
d3.selectAll("li")
	.classed("items", true);

// removes "first-paragraph" class from all p tags:
d3.selectAll("p")
	.classed("first-paragraph", false);
```

If you don't supply a second argument to `classed`, it will simply tell you whether the first element in your selection has the class you pass into it:

```javascript
d3.select(".first-paragraph")
	.classed("first-paragraph"); // true

d3.select("ol")
	.classed("this-should-return-false"); // false
```

Also like in jQuery, there are `text` and `html` methods in d3 to set the inner text and inner HTML of a selection. Try these out in the console:

```javascript
d3.select("h1")
	.text("New Title!");
	
d3.select("body")
	.html("<h6>Whoops, all gone.</h6>");
```

If you'd like to read more about the selection API in d3, head over to the [docs](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection).



### Passing Functions to D3 Methods

So far we've only passed primitive values into our selection methods. But we can also pass in functions. Check this out:

```javascript
d3.selectAll("li")
	.text(function() {
		return Math.random() + " is a random number!"; 
	});
```

When you throw this into the console, you should see that each `li` gets its own random number: in other words, the callback function to `text` is being executed once per matching element in the selection.

While this example might seem a little contrived, it's not at all uncommon for you to want to iterate through a selection of elements and apply some function to each one. Here's a more realistic example:

```javascript
d3.selectAll("li")
	.style("background-color", function(d,i) {
		if (i % 2 === 1) return "#cccccc";
	});
```

In this example, we're using d3 to stripe the list, so that every other item has a different background color. How did we do this? Well, in these callback functions, the second argument refers to the index of the element within the current selection group. In d3, this argument is typically denoted `i`. So the callback is basically returning a light gray hex code whenever the index is odd.

What about that first argument in the callback, the one we called `d`? That's a great question! We'll come to that in the next section.

Want another example? Try the following:

1. Select the `p` tag with a class of 'first-paragraph'
2. call the `style` method on the selection, and get ready to set the `color` of the selection.
3. To determine the color, generate a random number. If it's less than 0.5, set the color to be red. Otherwise, set it to be blue.

Try executing your code several times in the console to ensure that it randomly sets the paragraph's text to be one of these two colors!

__EXERCISE 1__

Using the sample html from above, do the following tasks:

1. Select all the p tags on the page, give the text a random font size, change the background color to black and the text color to orange.
2. Give the first li on page a padding of 20px

### Adding to and removing from the DOM with d3

Also as with jQuery, you can use d3 to add or remove elements from the DOM. To remove an item, create a selection and then call `.remove()` on it:

```javascript
d3.select("p").remove();
```

To add elements to the DOM, d3 provides the `append` and `insert` methods. The `append` method is more straightforward: it simply appends the element you want to add as the last child of each element in your selection:

```javascript
// append hr tags to each li:
d3.selectAll("li")
	.append("hr");
```

`insert` works in a similar way, but it allows you to pass in a second argument which specifies where to insert the new element. The new element will be placed _before_ the second argument in the DOM.

```javascript
// insert an hr tag before the h1:
d3.select("body")
	.insert("hr","h1");
```

For more details on these methods, check out the [docs](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#modifying-elements).

### Event Listeners in d3

Here's another similarity to jQuery: there's an `on` method used for registering event listeners. Unlike jQuery, though, the callback doesn't take the event object as an argument. If you want details of the event, use `d3.event`:

```javascript
d3.select("h1").on('mouseover', function() {
	console.log(d3.event);
});
```

You can access the event target using `d3.event.target`, or you can simply use the keyword `this`, which will refer to the DOM element that triggered the event. 

__EXERCISE 2__

Use d3 to randomly change an li's color when you click on the li.

## SVG

SVG (short for Scalable Vector Graphics) is a way for us to draw images in the DOM. The use of vector graphics means that the images don't degrade in quality as you resize them (for more on vector graphics, Wikipedia offers a [nice starting point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics)). The [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) perhaps summarize it best: "SVG is essentially to graphics what HTML is to text.

Important SVG elements that we'll be using:

__circle__

<svg height="220" width="220">
<circle
  cx=110
  cy=110
  r=100
  stroke="#ff0000"
  stroke-width="4"
  fill='#0000ff'/>
 </svg>

```
<svg height="220" width="220">
  <circle
   cx=110
   cy=110
   r=100
   stroke="#ff0000"
   stroke-width="4"
   fill='#0000ff'/>
 </svg>
```

__rect__


<svg height="200" width="200">
<rect
  x=0
  y=0
  width=200
  height=200
  fill="#ffffff"
  stroke="#000000"
  stroke-width="4" />
</svg>


```
<svg height="200" width="200">
<rect
  x=0
  y=0
  width=200
  height=200
  fill="#ffffff"
  stroke="#000000"
  stroke-width="4" />
</svg>
```

__rect__ (rounded corners)

<svg height="215" width="210">
<rect
  x=5
  y=5
  rx=35
  ry=35
  width=200
  height=200
  fill="#15Cf2A"
  stroke="#000000"
  stroke-width="4" />
</svg>


```
<svg height="215" width="210">
<rect
  x=5
  y=5
  rx=35
  ry=35
  width=200
  height=200
  fill="#15Cf2A"
  stroke="#000000"
  stroke-width="4" />
</svg>
```

__path__

<svg height="175" width="350">
<path
  d="M160 5 L5 155 L310 150Z"
  fill="rgb(10,180,190)"
  stroke-width="5"
  stroke="black" />
</svg>

```
<svg height="175" width="350">
<path
  d="M160 5 L5 155 L310 150Z"
  fill="rgb(0,255,0)"
  stroke-width="5"
  stroke="black" />
</svg>
```

__g__ (group)

The _g_ element is used to group other svg elements:

<svg height="250" width="300">
  <g stroke="black" stroke-width="3">
    <circle cx=55 cy=55 r=50 fill="#006BB6"/>
    <rect x=100 y=100 width=100 height=100 fill="#FDB927"/>
  </g>
</svg>

```
<svg height="250" width="300">
  <g stroke="black" stroke-width="3">
    <circle cx=55 cy=55 r=50 fill="#006BB6"/>
    <rect x=100 y=100 width=100 height=100 fill="#FDB927"/>
  </g>
</svg>
```


__EXERCISE 3__

Create an svg that has a triangle inside of a square inside of a circle.  Put all of those elements in a group with some shared properties on the group:


<svg height="230" width="250">
  <g stroke="black" stroke-width="1">
    <circle cx=110 cy=110 r=100 fill="#006BB6"/>
    <rect x=60 y=60 width=100 height=100 fill="#FDB927"/>
    <path
      d="M80 150 L80 80 L150 150Z"
      fill="rgb(0,255,0)"
      stroke="black" />
  </g>
</svg>

## D3 With SVG

d3 relies on SVG pretty heavily for drawing graphs. Let's create an SVG element and draw some rectangles and circles.

We can use the same HTML starter code as before. Let's begin by appending an SVG to the DOM! 

```javascript
d3.select("body")
  .append("svg")
    .attr("width", 500)
    .attr("height", 500);
```

You might be wondering what's up with the spacing in the above code. From the [d3 docs](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection):

>By convention, selection methods that return the current selection use _four_ spaces of indent, while methods that return a new selection use only _two_. This helps reveal changes of context by making them stick out of the chain.

In this case, the indentation is meant to help emphasize the fact that the `width` and `height` attributes that are being set are on the `svg`, not on the `body`.

Let's create our first rectangle with D3. How can we do this in d3? By appending a `rect` element to our svg!

```javascript
d3.select('svg')
  .append('rect')
    .attr('width',100)
    .attr('height',200)
    .attr('x',50)
    .attr('y',150)
    .attr('fill','red')
    .attr('stroke-width',5)
    .attr('stroke','blue');
```

That's a lot of attributes we've just set, but if you type this code correctly you should see a red rectangle with a blue border appear in your svg!

Once you've drawn your rectangle, let's draw a circle too!

```javascript
d3.select('svg')
  .append('circle')
    .attr('cx',250)
    .attr('cy',200)
    .attr('r',100)
    .attr('fill','purple');
```

## Joining Data

Next, we'll start introducing data into our D3 examples. To begin, let's create some HTML boilerplate:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Putting the Data in d3</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Read this important article!</h1>

  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

In the Chrome console, let's learn about one of the most important d3 methods: the `data` method.

Before explaining how this method works, or what it's used for, let's first just examine a quick example:

```javascript
d3.selectAll('p')
	.data([4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40])
	.style('font-size', function(d) {
		return d + 'px';
	});
```

This example shows the power of the d3 data method. It allows you to bind data to DOM elements, then use that data to affect the look of those elements on the page. 


So how does this work? When you call the `data` method on a selection, under the hood d3 is adding a private `__data__` property to HTML elements in the selection. Refresh the page and try the following:

```javascript
document.querySelector('p').__data__; // undefined

// Let's bind some data...
d3.selectAll('p')
	.data([4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40])
	
document.querySelector('p').__data__; // 4 - the data value has been joined to the p tag!
```

While you can access this property, you shouldn't ever be manipulating it directly. If you need to update the data, just call `data` on the selection again! Refresh the page once more and try this out:

```javascript
d3.selectAll('p')
	.data([4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40]);
	
document.querySelector('p').__data__; // 4

d3.selectAll('p')
	.data(["first", 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40]);
	
document.querySelector('p').__data__; // "first"
```

### Surplus data: the `enter` method

In the previous example, the number of data points we had (i.e. the size of the array we passed in to `data`) was equal to the number of paragraphs we had on the page. But very often, there's a mismatch between your data and the number of elements. For example, you may need to get some data via AJAX without knowing beforehand how many data points you're getting. So how can you be sure you'll have enough elements on the page to display the data?

When you have data without any corresponding elements, the way to deal with them is with d3's `enter` method.

For example, suppose you have the following html:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Putting the Data in d3</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Things to do</h1>	
  <ul></ul>
  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js"></script>
  <script src="todos.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

In your `todos.js`, let's write out some things to do:

```javascript
var todos = [
	"Create 1000 data visualizations with d3",
	"Eat dinner",
	"Sleep",
	"Hang out with friends"
];
```

Then, in the same JavaScript file, let's try to bind these todo items to HTML elements.

```javascript
d3.select("ul")
  .selectAll("li")
    .data(todos);
```

This code may seem a bit strange. After all, our HTML has a `ul`, but that `ul` doesn't have any `li`s in it. So when we select all of the `li`s, aren't we getting an empty selection?

At first, yes! In fact, if you refresh the page and take a look at `d3.select("ul").selectAll("li").nodes()`, you should see an empty array. But the power of the `data` function is that it allows us to bind to elements that _aren't yet present on the page_.

If you take a look at `d3.select("ul").selectAll("li").data(todos)` in the Chrome console, you'll see a d3 selection object which is similar to the ones we encountered in the previous chapter, but with an important difference: there are now two new key-value pairs! In addition to the `_groups` key and the `_parents` key that we saw before, there's an `_enter` key and an `_exit` key as well. We'll talk about `_exit` momentarily, but for now, let's investigate `_enter`.

To expose what's in the `_enter` property, we use the `enter` method. Let's take a look at the nodes inside of the enter selection:

```javascript
d3.select("ul")
  .selectAll("li")
    .data(todos)
    .enter()
    .nodes();
```

You should see that `nodes` returns an array of `EnterNode` objects to you. You can think of this as a placeholder: each `EnterNode` is basically a placeholder for some DOM element that doesn't exist yet. However, the `EnterNode` does keep track of the data that should be bound to it.

So how do we generate the actual HTML elements on the page? By appending them! Try this code out:

```javascript
d3.select("ul")
  .selectAll("li")
    .data(todos)
    .enter()
  .append("li")
    .text(function(d,i) {
    	return "Todo #" + (i + 1) + ": " + d;
    });  
```

With this, your todos will render to the page!

### Creating our first bar chart

Let's take a look at another example, this one using an SVG. Here's some HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Putting the Data in d3</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.js"></script>
  <script src="bar.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Let's draw a bar chart! Take a look at the following code and try to understand it line-by-line:

```javascript
const svgWidth = 500;
const svgHeight = 500;
const barWidth = 90;
const barGap = 10;

d3.select("body")
  .append("svg")
    .attr("width", svgWidth)
    .attr("height", svgHeight)
  .selectAll('rect')
    .data([
      svgHeight * Math.random(), 
      svgHeight * Math.random(), 
      svgHeight * Math.random(), 
      svgHeight * Math.random(), 
      svgHeight * Math.random()
    ])
    .enter()
  .append('rect')
    .attr('width', barWidth)
    .attr('height', d => d)
    .attr('y', d => svgHeight - d)
    .attr('x', (d, i) => (barWidth + barGap) * i)
    .attr('fill', 'blue');
```

Let's discuss the code.

### Surplus elements: the `exit()` method

We've seen that if you join more data to a selection than you have elements, you gain access to an enter selection which lets you append elements to the DOM which are automatically joined to this excess data. But what about the opposite problem, when you join _less_ data to a selection than you have elements? In this case, you can use d3's _exit_ selection!

The most common use case for `exit` is when you remove some data and want to then remove the corresponding element on the page. Let's take a look at a quick example. Let's revisit our list of todos from before, but add an event listener so that clicking on a todo removes it. Let's use the HTML from before, and start with the JavaScript code that adds the todos to the page:

```javascript
var todos = [
	"Create 1000 data visualizations with d3",
	"Eat dinner",
	"Sleep",
	"Hang out with friends"
];

d3.select("ul")
  .selectAll("li")
    .data(todos)
    .enter()
  .append("li")
    .text(function(d,i) {
    	return "Todo #" + (i + 1) + ": " + d;
    });  
```

Below this code, let's add some logic for the event listeners:

```javascript
d3.selectAll('li').on('click', function(d) {

  // find the current todo's index in the array and remove it
  var idx = todos.indexOf(d);
  todos.splice(idx,1)
  
  // update the DOM
  d3.selectAll('li')
    .data(todos)
      .text(function(d,i) {
        return "Todo #" + (i + 1) + ": " + d;
      })
    .exit()
    .remove();

});
```

As you can see, the first thing that happens on click is that we find the index of the todo that was just clicked on, and then use `splice` to remove that todo from our array. This isn't enough, however; we also need to update the page!

Next, we select all of the `li`s, join them to the new data and update the text. It's the last two lines that are new: first we grab the exit selection by calling `exit`, and then we remove those elements from the page. To appreciate the importance of those two lines, try commenting them out and running the code again. Without calling `.exit().remove()`, the elements corresponding to data that no longer exists continue to linger on the page.


## D3 Scales

Scales are a very important feature in D3.  It's the toolbelt that helps to make graphing easier, since we do not have to worry about projecting our data into a small domain on our own.

We'll be using this html:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>D3 graphing</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
  <script src="states.js"></script>
  <script src="population.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

The `states.js` file is filled with data on different U.S. states; you can find the data [here](./states.js).

Create an `population.js` file. Inside of `population.js`, let's first use d3 to create an SVG and then bind some circles to the states data.

```js
var width = 500;
var height = 500;

var svg = d3.select("body")
          .append("svg")
            .attr("width", width)
            .attr("height", height);

svg.selectAll("circle")
 .data(states)
 .enter()
 .append("circle")
   .attr("cx", function(d) { return d.population; })
   .attr("cy", function(d) { return d.electoralVotes; })
   .attr("r", 10);

```

If you open up your `index.html` in Chrome, you should see a blank screen. You could try to do the following:

```js
svg.selectAll("circle")
     .data(states)
     .enter()
     .append("circle")
       .attr("cx", function(d) { return d.population/10000; })
       .attr("cy", function(d) { return d.electoralVotes*10; })
       .attr("r", 10);
```

But we would be reinventing the wheel, since D3 already provides scales for us.  A scale is just a mapping between two intervals: for example, if you want to map the points from 0 to 1 to the points from 0 to 100, a _linear_ scale would map 0.5 to 50, 0.25 to 25, and so on.

D3 has built-in functionality for creating and using scales. Here's how we can scale our data to better fit in the SVG:

```js
const width = 500;
const height = 500;
const xMin = d3.min(states, function(d) { return d.population; });
const xMax = d3.max(states, function(d) { return d.population; });
const yMin = d3.min(states, function(d) { return d.electoralVotes; });
const yMax = d3.max(states, function(d) { return d.electoralVotes; });

var xScale = d3.scaleLinear()
               .domain([xMin,xMax])
               .range([0,width]);

var yScale = d3.scaleLinear()
               .domain([yMin,yMax])
               .range([height,0]);
               
var svg = d3.select("body")
          .append("svg")
            .attr("width", width)
            .attr("height", height);

svg.selectAll("circle")
   .data(states)
   .enter()
   .append("circle")
     .attr("cx", function(d) { return xScale(d.population); })
     .attr("cy", function(d) { return yScale(d.electoralVotes); })
     .attr("r", 10);
```

There are a few things going on here. First, we're using d3's `min` and `max` methods to calculate the minimum and maximum values for population and electoral votes. This affords us greater flexibility: we don't have to manually go through the data to find the min and max, and if we added or removed data, we could call these methods again to update the min and max for us.

Next we're creating two linear scales. When you create a scale in this way, you need to define two things: a _domain_ and a _range_. The domain is the interval of values you're mapping _from_ (in this case, the min and max values of our data). The range is the interval of values you're mapping _to_, and will almost always depend on the dimensions of the SVG.

If you're confused by the scales, just play around with them in the Chrome console. You'll see that they really do map numbers from one interval to numbers in another.

```js
var yMin = d3.min(states, function(d) { return d.electoralVotes; });
var yMax = d3.max(states, function(d) { return d.electoralVotes; });

var yScale = d3.scaleLinear()
               .domain([yMin,yMax])
               .range([height,0]);

yMin; // 3
yMax; // 55 - California has lots of people in it.

yScale(3); // 500 - note we flip the yScale so that the yMin gets mapped to 500, which is at the BOTTOM of the SVG
yScale(55); // 0
yScale(29); // 250 - the midpoint of one interval gets mapped to the midpoint of the other interval, as expected.
```

Finally, once we have our scales, we use them when we plot the circles. Notice that we're not plotting the data itself anymore, but rather the result of the data after it's passed into either the _x_ or _y_ scale.

If you refresh the page, you should notice an immediate effect. The data now looks much more reasonable: as a state's population grows, so too does its number of electoral votes.

One slightly annoying thing is that the points at the extreme ends of the scale are getting cropped. While the centers of all the points fit in the SVG, the radii sometimes spill outside of the bounds. The most common way to fix this is to include some padding in the scales:

```js
var padding = 10;

var xScale = d3.scaleLinear()
               .domain([xMin,xMax])
               .range([padding,width - padding]);

var yScale = d3.scaleLinear()
               .domain([yMin,yMax])
               .range([height - padding,padding]);
```

If you want finer control over the padding you can set separate values for top, left, right, and bottom. But for now, we'll use one value for all four sides.


__EXERCISE 4__

Add a scale to the radius of our points based on the area of the state.

<img src="http://www.clipartkid.com/images/223/gold-weight-scales-icon-psd-psdgraphics-Q2R4yq-clipart.jpg">


__EXERCISE 5__

Let's graph a different relationship: median income versus population density. We don't have population density in our objects, but we can calculate it since we know total population and total area! This change will require us to alter how we calculate minima and maxima, as well as the `cx` and `cy` attributes on our circles

## Color Scales



Let's create one more scale, but this one will be a little different. Notice that in our set of data we keep track of how many democratic and republican representatives each state has. We can use this to calculate a measure of bipartisanship for each state. Our measurement will simply be the percentage of representatives who are Republican. In other words, a score of 1 means every representative is a Republican, a score of 0 means every representative is a Democrat, and a score of 0.5 means half of the representatives are Democrats and half are Republicans.

Let's first write a helper function to calculate this percentage:

```js
function partisanScore(d) {
  return d.republicanReps / (d.democraticReps + d.republicanReps);
}
```

Let's also create a scale which maps numbers from 0 to 1 onto colors. This might seem like a more complicated process: after all, until now we've always mapped intervals of numbers to other intervals of numbers. But in fact, d3's scales are quite flexible. Take a look!

```js
var colorScale = d3.scaleLinear()
                   .domain([0,1])
                   .range(["blue","red"]);
                   
// some examples
colorScale(0); // "rgb(0, 0, 255)"
colorScale(1); // "rgb(255, 0, 0)"
colorScale(0.5); // "rgb(128, 0, 128)"
colorScale(0.1); // "rgb(26, 0, 230)"
```

Cool, right? Now let's add some color to our points. We'll do this with the "fill" attribute:

```js
svg.selectAll("circle")
   .data(states)
   .enter()
   .append("circle")
     .attr("cx", function(d) { return xScale(d.population / d.area); })
     .attr("cy", function(d) { return yScale(d.medianIncome); })
     .attr("r", function(d) { return rScale(d.area); })
     .attr("fill", function(d) { return colorScale(partisanScore(d)); });
```

You can also set a border around the points if you like, using the `stroke` attribute.

We've now got a graph which illustrates our set of data across four dimensions: population density, land area, median income, and partisanship! Are there any other relationships in the data that you'd like to explore? Try altering the values for the `cx`, `cy`, or `r` attributes and see what other interesting relationships you can find!

## Axes

There are a number of other features that would be good to add to our graph, but we'll focus on just one more. Right now, there's no way to tell what relationship is being graphed, because we don't have any axes! 

Creating axes manually can be a real pain: you've got to decide on the scale, draw lines, draw tick marks, draw labels for the tick marks, and so on. d3 simplifies this process with a number of built-in axis methods. Let's continue with our current application, and see how we can create axes in just a few lines of code.

Let's start by creating a _y_ axis.

```js
svg.append('g')
  .attr("transform", "translate(" + padding + ",0)")
  .call(d3.axisLeft(yScale));
```

With this code we're doing a few things:

1. We're appending a new element to the SVG, called a `g` (short for "group")
2. We're moving this group to the right to account for our padding.
3. We're using d3's built-in `axisLeft` method to create an axis corresponding to our `yScale`.

After that, d3 takes care of the rest! It makes the lines, the tick marks, and the tick labels. It doesn't do everything: if you want a label for the axis, you'll need to do that yourself. And if you want more fine-grained control over the tick marks, you should check out the [docs](https://github.com/d3/d3-axis). But this is a pretty good amount of functionality for just three lines of code! (If your axis labels are getting cropped, you can increase the padding or use `axisRight` instead of `axisLeft`.)

The code for the _x_ axis is very similar:

```js
svg.append('g')
   .attr("transform", "translate(0," + (height - padding) + ")")
   .call(d3.axisBottom(xScale));
```

If you want to change the default styles of the axes, you can do that with CSS or by setting styles when you append the group. Note that the default axis styling for version d3 wasn't the nicest; it's been cleaned up quite a bit in v4.

## Bar Chart Exercise

Let's revisit bar charts briefly and create one with our data instead of a scatterplot. There's a lot of data to choose from: let's create a bar graph that plots the median income for each state, and colors the bars by partisanship. You should try to implement as much of this as possible on your own, before continuing on to the discussion.

You will need a new type of scale for this example, _band_ scale.  Here is how you might use it:


```js
var xScale = d3.scaleBand()
               .domain(states.map(d => d.name))
               .range([padding.left,width - padding.right])
               .padding(0.1);
```

<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/03/25/16/26/bar-chart-297122_960_720.png" style="height:500px">

We'll begin with a similar approach to what we did with the scatterplot: we'll make an SVG, give it some width and height, and create a scale for the _y_ axis which is generated from the data on median income. We'll keep our color scale too. Finally, we'll also want better control over the padding, so we'll specify different padding values for each of the four sides of the SVG.

```js
var width = 1000;
var height = 600;
var padding = {
  left: 40,
  top: 10,
  right: 0,
  bottom: 100
};

var svg = d3.select("body")
            .append("svg")
              .attr("width", width)
              .attr("height", height);

var yMin = d3.min(states, function(d) { return d.medianIncome; });
var yMax = d3.max(states, function(d) { return d.medianIncome; });

var yScale = d3.scaleLinear()
               .domain([yMin,yMax])
               .range([height - padding.top,padding.bottom]);
               
var colorScale = d3.scaleLinear()
                   .domain([0,1])
                   .range(["blue","red"]);               
``` 

Our _x_ axis is different in this case, because we're not scaling numbers to numbers, or even colors to numbers. Instead, what we want is an _ordinal_ scale: we just want to rank states and label them by their names. 

Fortunately, d3 provides us with another type of scale to deal with this scenario: a _band_ scale. We can use this scale to map a set of non-numeric data (e.g. a list of state names) onto our axis. Here's the syntax for that scale:

```js
var xScale = d3.scaleBand()
               .domain(states.map(function(d) {
                 return d.name;
               }))
               .range([padding.left,width - padding.right])
               .padding(0.1);
```

The `padding` method lets us specify how much space we want in between our bars. The larger the number that we pass in (between 0 and 1), the more space there will be.

Next, we need to create our rectangles. We'll also need our `partisanScore` function from before, to control the fill of each rectangle:

```js
let rects = svg.selectAll("rect")
   .data(states)
   .enter()
   .append("rect");

rects
	.attr("x", function(d) { return xScale(d.name); })
	.attr("width", xScale.bandwidth())
	.attr("y", function(d) {return yScale(d.medianIncome) - padding.bottom + padding.top; })
	.attr("height", function(d) { return height - yScale(d.medianIncome); })
	.attr("fill", function(d) { return colorScale(partisanScore(d)); });
	     
function partisanScore(d) {
  return d.republicanReps / (d.democraticReps + d.republicanReps);
}
```

There are a couple of things to note. First, the band scale does a fair amount of the work when it comes to drawing the scale. The `x` attribute is set by the scale itself; as for the width, the scale has a method on it called `bandwidth` which will automatically size the rectangles so that they are as wide as they need to be to fill the SVG.

The vertical components are a bit trickier. The `y` attribute isn't so bad, but you need to remember to account for the padding on top and bottom of the SVG. If we don't, there won't be enough room along the bottom for the x-axis along with its labels. The height is probably the trickiest one to get right. Since the scale itself transforms large incomes to small values, we need to subtract the height from the value of the scale. If you don't do this, bars which should be short will be tall (and vice versa).

Finally, we can add our axes. The _y_ axis should look quite familiar:

```js
svg.append('g')
     .attr("transform", `translate(${padding.left},${-padding.bottom+padding.top})`)
     .call(d3.axisLeft(yScale));
```

However, the _x_ axis requires a bit more care. If we try to do what we did for the _y_ axis, the code should look like this:

```js
svg.append('g')
     .attr("transform", `translate(0,${height - padding.bottom+padding.top})`)
     .call(d3.axisBottom(xScale))
```

Unfortunately, this presents a problem: the text along the axis is unreadable! Because the state names are all horizontally aligned and relatively long, they overlap on top of one another.

One solution is to rotate the text by 90°:

```js
svg.append('g')
     .attr("transform", `translate(0,${height - padding.bottom+padding.top})`)
     .call(d3.axisBottom(xScale))
   .selectAll("text")
     .attr("transform", "rotate(90)");
```

Now the text is vertically aligned, but it's too high up and not quite centered relative to the tick mark. With a little bit of nudging, we can get things looking good:

```js
svg.append('g')
     .attr("transform", `translate(0,${height - padding.bottom+padding.top})`)
     .call(d3.axisBottom(xScale))
   .selectAll("text")
     .attr("transform", `rotate(90) translate(${padding.top},${(-3-xScale.bandwidth()/2)})`)
     .style("text-anchor", "start");
```

Notice that we not only translated the text elements a bit, we also set the `text-anchor` property to `start` (rather than its default of `middle`). For more on this property, check out [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/text-anchor).

That's it! We've created a bar chart in d3 using real-world data. What other data would you like to see in bar chart form?

## Tooltips

A typical trick for creating a tool tip is to create a div that will be your tooltip, and then add css to make the position absolute and the opacity initially 0.  Your css might look like this:

```html
  <style>
    div.tooltip {
      position: absolute;
      text-align: center;
      padding: 5px;
      border-radius: 5px;
      font-size: 1em;
      background: lightgrey;
    }
  </style>
```

Then in your javascript, have d3 create a div and add the tooltip class to it:

```
  var tooltipDiv = d3.select('body')
                    .append("div")
                      .attr('class', 'tooltip')
                      .style("opacity", 0);
```

Next, we need to save the rects that we are creating to a variable (called `rects` in this case) and add our mouseover and mouseout events to it:

```
  rects.on("mouseover", function(d) {
        // Setting the html inside of our div
        tooltipDiv.html("<p>"+d.name +"</p>");
        
        // Get the value of the height and width of the div
        // so that we can determine where to place it on the screen
        var width = parseInt(tooltipDiv.style("width"));
        var height = parseInt(tooltipDiv.style("height"));
        
        
        // Using absolute positioning, put the left side of the div
        // where the mouse is minus half of the width of the div
        // This essentially means the middle of the div will be positioned
        // where the mouse is on the x axis
        tooltipDiv.style("left", `${d3.event.pageX - (width / 2)}px`);
        
        // Position the y value for the top of the div above the mouse
        tooltipDiv.style("top", `${d3.event.pageY - height - 20}px`);
        
        // Making the div visible
        tooltipDiv.style("opacity",1);
     })
     .on("mouseout", function() {
      // Hide the div on mouse out
      tooltipDiv.style("opacity", 0);
     })
```

If you run into a problem where the div shows up and then immediately hides, you have have to put the div higher so that it doesn't show up under your mouse and then cause a mouseout event to happen.


## D3 Transitions

In D3 we use transitions to animate our visualizations.  Typically, a transition is just starting your data at an initial value and then moving it to another value over time.

If we want to make the bar chart animate in, let's do the following.  First, save the rects that you create for the chart:

```
 var rects = svg.selectAll("rect")
   .data(states)
   .enter()
   .append("rect")
     .attr("x", function(d) { return xScale(d.name); })
     .attr("width", xScale.bandwidth())
     .attr("y", height - padding.bottom)
     .attr("height", 0)
     .attr("fill", function(d) { return colorScale(partisanScore(d)); });
```

Notice that the height is set to 0 and the y value is set to the bottom of the chart.

Next, we'll add a transition that animates to the full value of each bar:

```
 // describes our transition.
 // We can add a ease function here as well
 var t = d3.transition()
             .duration(2000);
 
 // Next, add our transition to rects and set the y and
 // the height to the values that we want to visualized.            
 rects
    .transition(t)
      .ease(d3.easeExpOut) // setting a easeExpOut so it's not a linear animation
      .attr('y', d=> yScale(d.medianIncome) - padding.bottom + padding.top )
      .attr('height', (d) => {
        return height - yScale(d.medianIncome);
      })

```

You can see all of the pre-defined ease functions in the [d3-ease](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease) repo

	// generate random numbers between 0 and 255;
	var randomRed = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
	var randomBlue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
	var randomGreen = Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
	var randomColor = `rgb(${randomRed},${randomBlue},${randomGreen})`;
	d3.select(this).style('color', randomColor);
});
```

#### EXERCISE 4

```js

  const width = 500;
  const height = 500;

  const xMin = d3.min(states, function(d) { return d.population; });

  const yMin = d3.min(states, function(d) { return d.electoralVotes; });
  const yMax = d3.max(states, function(d) { return d.electoralVotes; });
  const rMin = d3.min(states, function(d) { return d.area; });
  const rMax = d3.max(states, function(d) { return d.area; });

  var padding = 20;

  var xScale = d3.scaleLinear()
                 .domain([xMin, xMax])
                 .range([padding, width - padding]);

  var yScale = d3.scaleLinear()
                 .domain([yMin, yMax])

                 .range([5,20]);

  var svg = d3.select("body")
              .append("svg")
                .attr("width", width)
                .attr("height", height);

});
```

#### EXERCISE 5

```js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {

  var width = 500;
  var height = 500;
  var padding = 10;

  var svg = d3.select("body")
              .append("svg")
                .attr("width", width)
                .attr("height", height);

  var xMin = d3.min(states, function(d) { return d.population / d.area; });
  var xMax = d3.max(states, function(d) { return d.population / d.area; });
  var yMin = d3.min(states, function(d) { return d.medianIncome; });
  var yMax = d3.max(states, function(d) { return d.medianIncome; });

  var xScale = d3.scaleLinear()
                 .domain([xMin,xMax])
                 .range([padding,width - padding]);

  var yScale = d3.scaleLinear()
                 .domain([yMin,yMax])
                 .range([height - padding,padding]);

  svg.selectAll("circle")
     .data(states)
     .enter()
     .append("circle")
       .attr("cx", function(d) { return xScale(d.population / d.area); })

### Additional Resources

We've covered a fair amount of ground when it comes to d3, but there's still plenty left to discover. Here are some other areas to learn about if you're interested:

- Check out the [docs](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale) to learn more about other kinds of scales available in d3.
- You can learn more about transitions [here](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition).
- d3's `data` function takes an optional second argument, called a key function. What do these functions do, and what's a good use case for them? ([This](http://code.hazzens.com/d3tut/lesson_4.html) lesson is a good place to start.)
